gunicorn
```

Your requirements.txt should look something like:
```
Flask
gunicorn
flask-cors
# ... other dependencies
```

### **Step 2: Update Build Command in Render**

Go to your Render dashboard → Settings → **Build Command** and use:
```
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Update Start Command**

Based on the logs showing `'gunicorn backend.app:app'`, your Start Command should be:
```
gunicorn backend.app:app
```

Or try without the backend prefix:
```
cd backend && gunicorn app:app
```

## **Alternative: If you want to keep it simple**

If you don't want to use gunicorn, you can use Flask's built-in server:

**Start Command:**
```
python backend/app.py
